4chan-Image-Fetcher
===================

Downloads images from 10 pages of a 4chan board and conveniently saves them to the desktop in a folder with the board name.

Does not enter the threads to download thread images, just the "front page" of each page of the board. 

To run the script, cd to the directory of the script and then type the following:

python chanFetch.py pol

'pol' is the name of a board on 4chan, and that was just an example.

Enjoy.
