4chan-Image-Fetcher
===================

Downloads all images from front page of any 4chan board and conveniently saves them to the desktop in a folder with the board name.

To run the script, cd to the directory of the script and then type the following:

python chanFetch.py pol

'pol' is the name of a board on 4chan, and that was just an example.

Enjoy.
